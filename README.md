# Jets Project
## Second-Week Graded Project
### Michael Maldonado, Skill Distillery student

*Object-Oriented programming
*Inheritance
*Interfaces

completed the  project today and applied OO principles using classes and instantiation.
the challenges that i ran into were instantiating inside a while loop for my menu
wich cleared adding a jet to the list of jets. I would say that having to copy element by element
to grow an object array was also painfull vs using list.
